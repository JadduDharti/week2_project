# Rock-Paper-Scissors Application

#For this project, you and your partner(s) will work to create a program that has a 
#"player" and a "computer" adversary. 
#The computer should randomly choose its decision based on a 
#list of actions it can take("Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors"). 
#The player should then have a chance to input their decision.



#Main Coding starts from here.
